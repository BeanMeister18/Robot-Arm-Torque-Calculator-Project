Functionality of the program (Robot Arm Torque Calculator):

The algorithm accepts 5 inputs: 
- The x and y coordinates the arm needs to reach
- The length of each individual arm section (3 separate sections)

The program outputs the angles at which the three arm sections are positioned at relative to the x-axis, as well as the torque values of the base, elbow and wrist of the arm.
There are three cases with different positions, which are described in the report.
